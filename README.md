# Java Universal Recommendation Template


The Universal Recommender (UR) is a Cooccurrence type that creates correlators from several user actions, events, or profile information and performs the recommendations query with a Search Engine. It also supports item properties for filtering and boosting recommendations. This allows users to make use of any part of their user's clickstream or even profile and context information in making recommendations. TBD: several forms of popularity type backfill and content-based correlators for content based recommendations. Also filters on property date ranges. With these additions it will more closely live up to the name "Universal"

See the scala-version github project for more information: [UR template scala](https://github.com/PredictionIO/template-scala-parallel-universal-recommendation)

This is a Cornell CS 5152 team project.
